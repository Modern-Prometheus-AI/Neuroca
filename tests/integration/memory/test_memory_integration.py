"""Integration tests for the NeuroCognitive Architecture memory systems.

These tests verify the interactions between Working Memory, Episodic Memory,

1. Information flow across memory tiers
2. End-to-end consolidation processes
3. Pattern recognition and abstraction
4. Biological constraints in the integrated system
