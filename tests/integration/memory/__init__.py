"""Memory system integration tests for NeuroCognitive Architecture.

This package contains integration tests specifically for the memory systems,
testing how Working Memory, Episodic Memory, and Semantic Memory interact
with each other and with the memory consolidation mechanisms.

Key aspects tested:
1. Information flow between memory tiers
2. End-to-end consolidation processes
3. Pattern recognition and abstraction from experiences to knowledge
4. Biological constraints maintained in the integrated system
5. Adaptation and learning across memory operations
