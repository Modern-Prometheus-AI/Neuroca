# Cognitive Control Architecture

This directory contains diagrams of the NeuroCognitive Architecture (NCA) cognitive control system at different levels of detail.

## Overview Diagrams

- [Cognitive Control Overview](./overview.md) - High-level view of the cognitive control system components
- [Attention Management Architecture](./attention.md) - Detailed view of the attention management subsystem
- [Decision Making Architecture](./decision.md) - Architecture of the decision-making components

## Component-Level Diagrams

- [Goal Management](./components/goals.md) - Goal representation, prioritization, and management
- [Inhibition System](./components/inhibition.md) - Cognitive inhibition mechanisms
- [Metacognition](./components/metacognition.md) - Self-monitoring and reflection capabilities
- [Planning System](./components/planning.md) - Planning and sequencing capabilities

The cognitive control system is a core component of the NeuroCognitive Architecture, providing mechanisms for attention, reasoning, decision-making, and executive function that are inspired by human cognition.
