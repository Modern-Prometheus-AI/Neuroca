## Memory Tier System

The NCA memory system is organized into three biologically-inspired tiers that work together to provide a comprehensive memory architecture:

### Working Memory (Short-Term Memory)

The Working Memory tier is responsible for temporarily holding information that is currently being processed:

1. **Core Components**:
   - Memory Buffer: Temporary storage area for active items
   - Attention Focus: Directs processing resources to specific items
   - Memory Chunking: Groups related items to increase effective capacity
   - Active Rehearsal: Maintains items through continuous activation

2. **Processing**:
   - Encoding/Retrieval: Fast storage and access mechanisms
   - Decay Mechanism: Automatic fading of memory items over time
   - Item Displacement: Replacement of older items when capacity is reached

3. **Properties**:
   - Limited Capacity: Follows Miller's Law (7Â±2 items)
   - Short Duration: Items persist for seconds to minutes without rehearsal
   - High Volatility: Easily disrupted by distractions
   - Immediate Access: No retrieval delay for items in working memory

### Episodic Memory (Medium-Term Memory)

The Episodic Memory tier stores experiences and events with their associated contexts:

1. **Core Components**:
   - Episode Store: Storage for complete episodic memories
   - Context Binding: Attaches contextual information to episodes
   - Temporal Sequencing: Maintains chronological order of episodes
   - Spatial Information: Records spatial context of memories

2. **Processing**:
   - Encoding/Retrieval: Mechanisms for storing and accessing episodes
   - Consolidation: Process of stabilizing memories after initial encoding
   - Reconsolidation: Modification of existing memories upon retrieval

3. **Properties**:
   - Medium Capacity: Larger than working memory, smaller than semantic
   - Medium Duration: Memories persist for days to years
   - Autobiographical Content: Personally experienced events
   - Event-Based Structure: Organized around discrete episodes

### Semantic Memory (Long-Term Memory)

The Semantic Memory tier provides long-term storage for general knowledge and facts:

1. **Core Components**:
   - Knowledge Base: Repository of general knowledge
   - Concept Network: Interconnected network of concepts and their relationships
   - Factual Information: Storage for facts independent of episodic context
   - Schema Organization: Structured frameworks for organizing knowledge

2. **Processing**:
   - Encoding/Retrieval: Mechanisms for storing and accessing semantic information
   - Semantic Embedding: Vector representations of concepts
   - Semantic Association: Connections between related concepts

3. **Properties**:
   - Large Capacity: Virtually unlimited storage
   - Long Duration: Persistent storage for years to lifetime
   - Hierarchical Structure: Organized in taxonomic networks
   - High Persistence: Resistant to decay over time

### Memory Tier Interactions

The memory tiers interact through several mechanisms:

1. **Consolidation**: Process by which memories are transferred from working memory to episodic memory, and from episodic to semantic memory
2. **Memory Transfer**: Movement of information between tiers based on relevance and usage
3. **Memory Promotion**: Elevation of important memories to more persistent tiers
4. **Memory Degradation**: Gradual fading of memories that aren't accessed frequently

### Cross-Tier Functions

Several functions operate across all memory tiers:

1. **Cross-Tier Search**: Ability to search for information across all memory tiers
2. **Assisted Recall**: Using information from one tier to aid retrieval from another
3. **Memory Integration**: Combining information from multiple tiers
4. **Memory Reinforcement**: Strengthening memories through repeated activation

The memory tier system is designed to mimic human memory processes, with information flowing between tiers based on frequency of use, relevance, and importance.
