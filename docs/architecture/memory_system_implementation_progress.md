# Memory System Refactoring Implementation Progress

**Last Updated:** April 14, 2025  
**Status:** Phase 2 In Progress - Storage Backend Components Complete

This document tracks the progress of the Neuroca memory system refactoring implementation according to the 5-phase plan outlined in [memory_system_refactoring.md](memory_system_refactoring.md).

## Phase 1: Detailed Architecture Design

### Completed Tasks

- [x] **Define Core Interfaces**
  - [x] Created `StorageBackendInterface` in `src/neuroca/memory/interfaces/storage_backend.py`

    - Includes optional capabilities for vector search and time-based operations
  - [x] Created `MemoryTierInterface` in `src/neuroca/memory/interfaces/memory_tier.py`
    - Defines tier-specific behaviors for STM, MTM, and LTM
    - Includes core operations, search/retrieval, and tier-specific methods

    - Defines the central public API for the memory system
    - Includes operations for the entire memory lifecycle

- [x] **Design Data Models**
  - [x] Created core memory models in `src/neuroca/memory/models/memory_item.py`
    - `MemoryItem`: Main data model for memory items
    - `MemoryContent`: Content structure with text and other data
    - `MemoryMetadata`: Metadata including importance, strength, tags
    - `MemoryStatus`: Status enumeration
  - [x] Created search models in `src/neuroca/memory/models/search.py`
    - `MemorySearchOptions`: Search parameters and options
    - `MemorySearchResult`: Individual search result with relevance
    - `MemorySearchResults`: Collection of results with metadata
  - [x] Created working memory models in `src/neuroca/memory/models/working_memory.py`
    - `WorkingMemoryItem`: Memory item in the working memory buffer
    - `WorkingMemoryBuffer`: Buffer management for context-relevant memories

### Remaining Tasks

- [x] **Create Exception Classes**
  - [x] Define custom exceptions for the memory system
  - [x] Created comprehensive exception hierarchy in `src/neuroca/memory/exceptions.py`
  - [x] Covers initialization errors, operation errors, item errors, and more

- [x] **Map Component Interactions**
  - [x] Create sequence diagrams for key operations
    - [x] Memory addition and storage
    - [x] Memory retrieval and search
    - [x] Memory consolidation between tiers
    - [x] Context update and working memory management
    - [x] Getting memories for prompt context
  - [x] Documented in `docs/architecture/memory_system_component_interactions.md`

- [x] **Finalize Directory Structure**
  - [x] Define final directory layout for all components
  - [x] Documented in `docs/architecture/memory_system_directory_structure.md`
  - [x] Covers all components with detailed organization

- [x] **Create Test Plan**
  - [x] Define test cases for each component
  - [x] Create test specifications for unit, integration, and system tests
  - [x] Documented in `docs/architecture/memory_system_test_plan.md`

## Phase 2: Implementation of New Core Components

### Completed Tasks

- [x] **Create Directory Structure**
  - [x] Established basic directory structure according to design
  - [x] Created subfolders as needed following Apex standards

- [x] **Implement Storage Backend Base Classes**
  - [x] Created `BaseStorageBackend` abstract base class in `src/neuroca/memory/backends/base.py`
  - [x] Implemented common functionality for all storage backends
  - [x] Defined abstract methods for specific backend implementations

- [x] **Implement In-Memory Backend**
  - [x] Created `InMemoryBackend` in `src/neuroca/memory/backends/in_memory_backend.py`
  - [x] Implemented all required methods from the interface
  - [x] Added support for basic operations (CRUD, batch, query)
  - [x] Added metadata handling and statistics

- [x] **Implement Backend Factory**
  - [x] Created factory package structure with one class per file
  - [x] Implemented `BackendType` enum for supported backend types
  - [x] Implemented `MemoryTier` enum for memory tier types
  - [x] Created `StorageBackendFactory` for backend instantiation
  - [x] Ensured proper organization following Apex standards

### Remaining Tasks

- [ ] **Implement Memory Tier Base Classes**
  - [ ] Create base tier implementation
  - [ ] Implement tier-specific logic

- [ ] **Implement Memory Manager**
  - [ ] Create manager implementation structure
  - [ ] Implement core manager functionality

## Phase 3: Migration of Existing Code

*Not started yet*

## Phase 4: Cleanup and Removal of Old Code

*Not started yet*

## Phase 5: Documentation and Final Validation

*Not started yet*

## Next Steps

1. **Continue Phase 2: Memory Tier and Manager Implementation**
   - Create the base memory tier implementation
   - Implement tier-specific behaviors for STM, MTM, and LTM
   - Create the memory manager implementation
   - Implement context management and memory retrieval

2. **Unit Testing**
   - Set up pytest configuration with asyncio support
   - Create test fixtures for the storage backends
   - Write unit tests for the implemented components
   - Implement integration tests for backend functionality

3. **Evaluation and Optimization**
   - Evaluate performance of the implemented components
   - Identify and address potential bottlenecks
   - Ensure proper error handling and resource management

## Notes

* The interface designs focus on clear separation of concerns:
  * Storage backends handle database interactions
  * Memory tiers handle tier-specific behaviors
  * Memory manager handles cross-tier operations
* All interfaces and models are designed with async operation in mind
* The data models use Pydantic for validation and serialization
