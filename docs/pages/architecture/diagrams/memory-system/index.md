# Memory System Architecture

This directory contains diagrams of the NeuroCognitive Architecture (NCA) memory system at different levels of detail.

## Overview Diagrams

- [Memory System Overview](./overview.md) - High-level view of the memory system components
- [Memory Tiers Architecture](./tiers.md) - Detailed view of the memory tier system
- [Memory Manager Architecture](./manager.md) - In-depth look at the memory manager

## Component-Level Diagrams

- [Memory Backends](./backends.md) - Storage backend implementations
- [Lymphatic System](./lymphatic.md) - Memory maintenance and garbage collection
- [Memory Annealing](./annealing.md) - Memory consolidation and optimization
- [Memory Tubules](./tubules.md) - Inter-memory communication system

The memory system is one of the core components of the NeuroCognitive Architecture, providing a biologically-inspired multi-tiered memory mechanism.
