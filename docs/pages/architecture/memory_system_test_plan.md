# Memory System Test Plan

**Last Updated:** April 14, 2025

This document outlines the comprehensive test plan for the Neuroca memory system. It defines the testing approach, test categories, and specific test cases for each component.

## Testing Approach

The memory system will be tested using a multi-layered approach:

1. **Unit Tests**: Test individual components in isolation
2. **Integration Tests**: Test interactions between components
3. **System Tests**: Test the entire memory system as a whole
4. **Performance Tests**: Measure performance characteristics
5. **Mutation Tests**: Ensure test quality by modifying code and verifying test failures

## Test Environment

- **Development**: Local environment with in-memory backends
- **CI/CD**: Automated tests in the CI pipeline with containerized dependencies
- **Staging**: Tests against full infrastructure in a staging environment

## Mocking Strategy

To isolate components during unit testing, the following mocking strategy will be used:

1. **Storage Backend Testing**
   - Mock actual database connections for unit tests
   - Use in-memory implementations where possible
   - Use real databases for integration tests

2. **Memory Tier Testing**
   - Mock storage backends for unit tests
   - Use real backends for integration tests

3. **Memory Manager Testing**
   - Mock memory tiers for unit tests
   - Use real tiers with mocked backends for integration tests
   - Use real tiers with real backends for system tests

## Test Data Strategy

1. **Synthetic Data**
   - Generate varied memory content, metadata, and embeddings
   - Ensure coverage of edge cases (empty content, large content, special characters)

2. **Realistic Data**
   - Sample real-world memory patterns for more realistic tests
   - Create scenarios that mimic actual user interactions

## Testing Tools

1. **Unit Testing Framework**: pytest
2. **Mocking**: pytest-mock, unittest.mock
3. **Coverage**: pytest-cov
4. **Async Testing**: pytest-asyncio
5. **Benchmarking**: pytest-benchmark
6. **Integration Testing**: TestContainers for database dependencies

## Continuous Integration

1. **Build Pipeline Stages**
   - Run unit tests
   - Run integration tests
   - Run performance tests
   - Generate and publish coverage reports

2. **Quality Gates**
   - Minimum code coverage: 90%
   - All tests must pass
   - No degradation in performance metrics
