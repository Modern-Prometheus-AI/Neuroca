Welcome to the official documentation for the NeuroCognitive Architecture (NCA) - a biologically-inspired cognitive framework that enhances Large Language Models with human-like memory systems, health dynamics, and adaptive cognitive processes.

## Overview

The NeuroCognitive Architecture (NCA) is a comprehensive framework that implements a three-tiered memory system, cognitive control mechanisms, and health dynamics inspired by human cognition. By integrating these components with modern Language Models, NCA enables more contextually aware, adaptive, and human-like AI systems.

## Key Features

- **Three-Tiered Memory System**
  - Working Memory with capacity constraints and activation decay
  - Episodic Memory with temporal context and emotional salience
  - Semantic Memory as a knowledge graph with concept relationships

- **Cognitive Control Mechanisms**
  - Executive functions for goal-directed behavior
  - Metacognition for self-monitoring and optimization
  - Attention management with focus and distraction handling

- **Health Dynamics**
  - Energy management and resource allocation
  - Simulated fatigue and recovery processes
  - Homeostatic regulation with adaptive responses

- **LLM Integration**
  - Provider-agnostic interfaces (OpenAI, Anthropic, Ollama)
  - Memory-enhanced prompting and context management
  - Health-aware response processing

- **Production-Ready Infrastructure**
  - Kubernetes deployment with auto-scaling
  - Comprehensive monitoring and alerting
  - Backup and restore procedures
  - Incident response runbooks

## Project Status

The NeuroCognitive Architecture has completed its implementation roadmap and is now considered production-ready. All major components have been implemented, tested, and optimized for performance:

- ✅ Package structure and dependency resolution
- ✅ Three-tiered memory system (Working, Episodic, Semantic)
- ✅ Health dynamics system with homeostatic mechanisms
- ✅ Cognitive control components for executive functions
- ✅ LLM integration layer with provider adapters
- ✅ Performance optimization with profiling and caching
- ✅ Production deployment with Kubernetes
