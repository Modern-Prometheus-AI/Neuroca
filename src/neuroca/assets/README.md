# Neuroca Assets

This directory stores static assets used by the NeuroCognitive Architecture application.

## Contents

- **Images**: Logos, icons, or other images used in documentation or potential UI components.
- **Templates**: Configuration templates, prompt templates, or other static template files.
- **Data Files**: Small, static data files needed by the application (e.g., default lists, mappings).

## Usage

These assets are typically read by different parts of the application as needed. For example, documentation might reference images, or the integration layer might load prompt templates.

## Maintenance

- Keep assets organized in subdirectories if the number grows.
- Ensure assets are reasonably sized and optimized where appropriate (e.g., compressing images).
- Remove unused assets periodically.
