"""
Inhibitory Control Component for NeuroCognitive Architecture (NCA).

This module implements inhibitory control mechanisms within the executive functions.
It is responsible for suppressing prepotent but inappropriate responses, cancelling
planned actions that are no longer relevant or safe, and managing interference
from distracting stimuli or conflicting goals.

Key functionalities:
- Response inhibition (suppressing automatic actions).
- Action cancellation (stopping ongoing or planned actions).
- Interference control (filtering distractions).
- Conflict monitoring (detecting competing responses/goals).
