"""
Task Planning Component for NeuroCognitive Architecture (NCA).

This module implements the planning capabilities within the executive functions.
It is responsible for generating sequences of actions (plans) to achieve
specified goals, considering the current state, available resources (including
memory and health), and potential obstacles.

Key functionalities:
- Goal decomposition into sub-goals and tasks.
- Action sequence generation.
- Plan adaptation based on execution feedback and changing conditions.
- Resource estimation for planned actions.
