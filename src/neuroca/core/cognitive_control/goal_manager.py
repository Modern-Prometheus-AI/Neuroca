"""
Goal Management Component for NeuroCognitive Architecture (NCA).

This module manages the system's goals, including their representation,
prioritization, activation status, and relationships to ongoing plans and actions.
It plays a crucial role in directing the system's behavior through goal-oriented
cognitive control.

Key functionalities:
- Representing goals with hierarchical relationships and dependencies
- Prioritizing goals dynamically based on urgency, importance, and context
- Tracking the status of active goals through their lifecycle
- Detecting and resolving conflicts between competing goals
- Managing goal persistence in memory for learning from past experiences
- Adapting goal management strategies based on health state
- Communicating active goals to other cognitive components
