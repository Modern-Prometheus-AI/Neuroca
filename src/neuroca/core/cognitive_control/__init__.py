Core Cognitive Control Module for NeuroCognitive Architecture (NCA).

This module implements higher-level cognitive functions, including:
- Executive Functions: Planning, decision-making, inhibition, goal management.
- Metacognition: Self-monitoring, confidence estimation, strategy selection.
- Attention Management: Focus allocation, distraction filtering.

These components orchestrate the lower-level memory and processing functions
to achieve complex, goal-directed behavior.
