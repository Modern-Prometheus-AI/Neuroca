"""
Decision Making Component for NeuroCognitive Architecture (NCA).

This module implements decision-making processes within the executive functions.
It evaluates potential actions or plans based on current goals, context,
predicted outcomes, resource availability (health/memory), and learned heuristics.

Key functionalities:
- Evaluating options against goals and constraints.
- Selecting the most appropriate action or plan.
- Incorporating uncertainty and risk assessment.
- Learning from past decision outcomes.
