"""
Attention Management Component for NeuroCognitive Architecture (NCA).

This module implements attention mechanisms, allowing the system to focus
its cognitive resources on relevant information or tasks while filtering
out distractions.

Key functionalities:
- Focus Allocation: Directing processing resources towards specific stimuli or internal processes.
- Distraction Filtering: Suppressing irrelevant sensory input or internal thoughts.
- Priority-Based Allocation: Assigning attention based on goal priority, stimulus salience, or health state.
- Context-Sensitive Shifting: Adjusting focus based on changes in the environment or task demands.
