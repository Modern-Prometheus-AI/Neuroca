"""
Memory decay functionality for the NCA system.

This module handles the decay of memories over time to simulate
the natural forgetting process of human memory.

⚠️ DEPRECATION WARNING ⚠️
This module is deprecated and will be removed in a future release.
Please use neuroca.memory.manager.MemoryManager for memory decay operations.
See src/neuroca/memory/README.md for migration guidance.
